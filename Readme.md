## event bubbling , event capturing 
## event propgation , immediate propogation & preventDefault


### event bubbling 

This happens form child to parent just likes bubbles.
Here it moves from button to div and then div to body and further on HTML

## EVENT CAPTURING / TRICKLING

This is executed from parent to child

## Prevent default 

It prevents the default behavoiur of the event 

For instance anchor tag open ups another page but if we use prevent defaut then it will go to another page 

# Events such as FOCUS AND BLUR DON'T BUBBLE

## DOM event target property use uppercase naming convention such as

```html
tagName: "BUTTON" ;
```
